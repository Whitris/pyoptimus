A modern, modular, open-source toolkit for profiling, analyzing, and optimizing Python code.

**PyOptimus** helps developers, ML engineers, and data scientists identify bottlenecks and improve the performance of real-world Python workloads — from scripts to data pipelines to APIs.

---

## Why PyOptimus?

- **Unified profiling:** CPU, memory, I/O, concurrency — all under one interface.
- **Actionable reports:** Get clear, human-readable HTML/Markdown reports with prioritized optimization suggestions.
- **Plug & play:** Use as a CLI, Python library, or inside Jupyter/Colab notebooks.
- **Built for real use:** Designed for modern data, ML, and backend scenarios.
- **Open and extensible:** Plugin system for custom analyzers and exporters.

## Key Features (Roadmap)

- Unified interface for CPU, memory, I/O, and async profiling.
- Clean, shareable reports (HTML, PDF, Markdown).
- Smart recommendations based on profiling results.
- Jupyter/Colab integration.
- Modular plugin architecture.
- Templates and recipes for ML/data/ETL/API use cases.
- Easy CLI and Python API.

*This project is in early development. Contributions, feedback, and feature requests are welcome!*
